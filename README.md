# A
## Introduction

This repository contains all the data, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks used to generate the results presented in our paper  
**"Development of a Variational Quantum Algorithm for Measurement Reduction via the Block-Encoding Method."**  
We publish this repository to support reproducibility of our results.

This document provides an overview of the repository structure and instructions on how to use the materials.  
Please read this carefully before attempting to reproduce the results.

All scripts and notebooks are written in Python. Required packages can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## data

This directory contains the data used to generate Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6.

It consists of four subdirectories, categorized by file type:

- npz: Numerical simulation results, either generated by scripts or included for reproduction.
- pdf: Figures reproduced from the Jupyter notebooks (`analyzation_for_Hydrogen_chain.ipynb`, `analyzation_for_N2.ipynb`). 
- rhf: Molecular Hamiltonian data in FCIDUMP format. Required for both scripts and notebooks.
- txt: Text logs describing simulation conditions and results.

In both `npz` and `txt`, two subdirectories are used:

- `for_paper`: Contains the exact data used to generate the final figures in the manuscript.
- `worked`: Intended for results reproduced by users running the provided scripts.

## notebook

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used to reproduce Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 in the paper.

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used to reproduce **Fig.3-6** in the paper.

To reproduce these figures, please execute the corresponding notebooks.
Before running, make sure the following dependencies are available in `vender` (via git clone).
  
## scripts

This directory contains Python scripts used to generate the data shown in **Fig.3–6** of the paper.

These scripts automatically perform quantum simulations and save results into `data`.
To use these scripts, please ensure the following repositories are cloned in `vender`.

## vender

This directory contains external repositories cloned via `git clone`, which are used as dependencies by the scripts and notebooks in this project.

The contents of this directory are **not authored** by the authors of this project. Instead, they are required for:
- reading Hamiltonian data files (e.g., `.fcidump`)
- constructing and simulating block-encoded quantum circuits
- other utility functions used throughout the project

All scripts and notebooks are configured to assume this directory structure. If you clone the repositories elsewhere, please update the relevant import paths accordingly.

### Included Repositories

- [`PItBE`](https://github.com/B-REO/PItBE): Library for block-encoding-based quantum simulations used throughout the project.
- [`quantum_software_handson`](https://github.com/Qulacs-Osaka/quantum_software_handson): Utility library including `qchem_util.py`, which helps parse `.fcidump` files.

Please ensure these repositories are cloned into this directory as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-REO/PItBE.git vendor/PItBE
git clone https://github.com/Qulacs-Osaka/quantum_software_handson.git vendor/quantum_software_handson
```

This ensures scripts and notebooks can properly import their modules using relative paths like:

```python
from qchem_util import ...
```
